# pystreambot-example
A combination of tools for use when streaming. This example file has private stuff removed, but serves as an example.

Uses a bunch of weird things. I don't feel like collecting all of it for listing. I can answer questions if needed.
I also didn't feel like finding the appropriate license for all of this. But that doesn't mean the modules and tools are unlicensed, that's just my laziness.
A bunch of things from this bot are also done on Linux. Like a lot of the subprocessing tasks. Might work on Mac, but things need to be downloaded. Might work on WSL, but I can't say for sure.
